## 🔧 Requirements

Before you get started, you need to have the following:

- [![Node.JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Recommend LTS or Higher)
- [![Lavalink](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lavalink-7289DA?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavalink) (V4 or Higher)
- [![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-47A248?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Required for MongoDB database)

## 🚀 Get Started

1. First clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theassassin0128/Node.git
```

2. Change to the directory:

```bash
cd Node
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pnpm install # you can also use npm if you want
```

> [!NOTE]
> Install `pnpm` if you don't have it installed

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

4. Copy `example.lavalink-nodes.js` to `lavalink-nodes.js`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using external nodes then add them. For locally hosted node no need to add extra info.

5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all the required values.

6. Now go to [Discord Developer Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) select your application and head to OAuth2 tab. In OAuth2 URL Generator select "bot" and "application.commands" scopes, scroll down select "Administrator" permission, copy the URL, open the URL and invite the bot to your server.

7. Start the bot:

```bash
# You can also use npm if you want
pnpm start
pnpm run dev # if you want to run in dev mode
```

8. Start using the bot. Use `/ping` or `/botinfo` commands.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the bot loads slash commands globally. To load slash commands to a single server, go to `src/config.js`, in `bot` change value of `global` to `false`. This will make sure that the slash commands are available only in your server.

## 🗝️ Sharding

**Sharding** is not recommended for bots that are in less than **2,000 servers**. By default the bot runs without sharding. To enable sharding, start the bot like this:

```bash
pnpm run shard
pnpm run devShard # if you want to run in dev mode
```

## 📜 Commands

> [!NOTE]
> There will be a dedicated markdown file for commands in future.
> For now here are some public commands of the bot.

| Name     | Description                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ping     | 🏓 Pong! Replies with bot's response time.     |
